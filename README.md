#VectorFLow 

""Introduction"" 
It is an python Generative model 
I Created this program with Python and to view and edit i have used Solid Python

""About""

This program after running the main file vectorflow.py the program generates and makes the shape in the virtual form
the model generates and will store the data of the generated part in a csv file 
it even generates the picture of the generated model and displays it the information in csv contains of the 
specs like the shape generated metal, density the date and such other useful information

""Running the program""

you can clone the program and run the "req.txt" and download the required dependiences in your local env to run the program 
and execute the program by runnuing the "vectorflow.py" python Program

""Tools used""

I have used tools while building like as usual vscode and i created a new env for it using miniconda and stored it 
as I wanted to generate a 3d model of it so i have used the Solid python app to run and view the program

""Personal Thought""

I had a nice expreience making this colabing with AI and makiing it WOW I got to learn many things though it is a base program i faced Mauny problems
like running mainly running it in a proper env and making it run actully and making the output csv file i had to do some Data Cleaning as there were some unessacary datas in it 

And at last had and got to learn many things
